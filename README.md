# ocl2

i guess i'll try to keep this up and running here: http://wishdrops.net/ocl/

as of 2019 espn changed their web site, so whatever scraping i had been doing to collect league history went away (luckily i had the stats for the first 15 years already downloaded). this version loads stats in the old format through 2018 then uses the espn v3 api format as the basis for loading data beginning in 2019. in the end i guess it was cool that their redesign gave me a chance to improve this app, using, like, a real interactive web page with colors and everything instead of just text printouts.
